/**
 * Nextra-shaped client wrapper for `remark-dgmo`'s framework-neutral
 * `bindDgmo()` function. Drop this once inside your `app/layout.tsx`
 * (typically alongside Nextra's layout) and it will:
 *
 *   - run `bindDgmo()` on initial mount, tightening every diagram's
 *     viewBox to content bounds and wiring showcase-mode copy buttons;
 *   - re-run `bindDgmo()` on every client-side route change (Next's
 *     app router does not refire `DOMContentLoaded` semantics on soft
 *     navigation).
 *
 * Lives in this package — not in `remark-dgmo` — so that Next's `'use
 * client'` directive and `next/navigation` import stay out of the
 * framework-agnostic core.

// Side-effect CSS import: Next's app-router CSS pipeline picks this up
// because the component is a Client Component imported from a layout.
// Self-references the package via its exports map so it works at both
// build time (tsup marks it external) and consumer time (Next resolves
// it through node_modules/nextra-dgmo/dist/client.css). Mounting
// `<DgmoClient />` is now the only thing a consumer has to do for both
// runtime rebinding AND theme-aware styling.
